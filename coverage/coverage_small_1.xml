    <title>The concept of the bridi</title>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>bridi</primary><secondary>concept of</secondary></indexterm> This chapter gives diagrammed examples of basic Lojban sentence structures. The most general pattern is covered first, followed by successive variations on the basic components of the Lojban sentence. There are many more capabilities not covered in this chapter, but covered in detail in later chapters, so this chapter is a 
      <quote>quick tour</quote> of the material later covered more slowly throughout the book. It also introduces most of the Lojban words used to discuss Lojban grammar.</para>
    <para> 


      Let us consider John and Sam and three statements about them:</para>

    <example xml:id="example-random-id-qIuj">
      <title> 
        <indexterm type="example"><primary>father</primary></indexterm>
        <indexterm type="example"><primary>John and Sam</primary></indexterm>

        <anchor xml:id="c2e1d1"/>
      </title>
      <para>John is the father of Sam.</para>
    </example>
    <para> <indexterm type="general"><primary>sumti</primary><secondary>relation with bridi</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>brivla</primary><secondary>relation to bridi</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>predication</primary><secondary>compared with bridi</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>bridi</primary><secondary>compared with predication</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>predication</primary><secondary>as a relationship</secondary></indexterm>  <indexterm type="general"><primary>relationship</primary><secondary>active/static/attributive compared</secondary></indexterm> These examples all describe relationships between John and Sam. However, in English, we use the noun 

      <quote>father</quote> to describe a static relationship in 
      <xref linkend="example-random-id-qIuj"/>, the verb 
      <quote>hits</quote> to describe an active relationship in 
      In formal logic this whole structure is called a
      <quote>predication</quote>; in Lojban it is called a
      <valsi>bridi</valsi>, and the central part of speech is the
      <valsi>selbri</valsi>.
